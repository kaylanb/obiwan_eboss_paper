%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

The imaging imaging systematics in SDSS turned out to be fairly independent of one another, so they could be removed with linear models for them (ashley's papers). However, the imaging systematics in the next generation of galaxy surveys (astronomy data sets) will be highly correlated. The data will come from a joint analysis of multiple telescopes' data and/or will have data of the same part of the sky collected over long timelines (months or years).

We want the measure the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal, but there are shortcomings in the current methods, such as having apriori knowledge of all the possible imaging systematics in the galaxy survey dataset. DESI will obtain spectra of about 30M galaxies that will be targeted based on multi-band imaging from three telescopes. eBOSS has already targeted and obtained spectra for about \# ELG galaxies, based on DECam data. People have already started confronting this issue, and the previous weight fitting was extended to multiple dimensions (features). Poole et al fit to 25 maps simultaneously.

This paper is the first analysis of large scale data, in this case for eBOSS and DESI, that uses \obiwan\, (Burleigh \& Moustakas 2018, in prep), which is a non-parametric method that corrects for the full covariance of imaging systematics. We perform a trial run on X deg$^2$ of the DR5 footprint, and then run \obiwan\, on the actual eBOSS footprint, restricting to the footprint described in \cite{anand17}. From these runs, we measure the impact of \obiwan\, on the primary science objectives of eBOSS and extrapolate to DESI. All data products are available at NERSC (see Section \ref{sec:data-products}).

\section{Methods}

\subsection{\obiwan}

The five images in Fig. \ref{fig:1000-words} show how Obiwan works. The process is identical to how the Legacy Survey Team produces their Public Data Releases, with one exception. Every time Legacypipe reads an image, we add sim- ulated sources to it. The pipeline doesn't know about the simulated sources so the source detection and model fitting procedure is unaltered. For more details see Burleigh \& Moustakas 2018, in prep. Fig. \ref{fig:examples-faint} show examples of real and simulated ELG-like galaxies with similar \gb \, magnitude that are near the DECaLS detection limit. 
%The ELGs are at our detection limits so visual inspection of single exposure images containing ELGs is challenging.

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{obiwan_1000_words}

The original image (top left) is modified by adding 4 simulated galaxies (top middle) to create the new image (top right), which {\tt{Tractor}} operates on. The model and residual images are the bottom panels. Two of the simulated galaxies (the more compact ones) have \dev profiles, while the other two have exponential profiles.}

The first column is a three color jpeg for easy visualization. The remaining columns are the per-band full resolution coadds for the \gb, \rband, \zb\, images and associated inverse variance maps. Consecutive rows of R and F (rows 1 and 2, 3 and 4, etc.) have similar g-band magnitude for a fair comparison. REPLACE WITH GALAXIES AT eBOSS G=22.9 LIMIT}
 \label{fig:examples-faint}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Randoms}

We add fake galaxies to the images at random locations, run \legacypipe, and repeat until there are many more simulated galaxies than real ones. The simulated galaxies that \legacypipe\, detects and models are the ``randoms" that a correlation function estimator would use. These randoms have been modified by the full covariance between all imaging systematics, those we expect such as stellar density and seeing, those previously unknown, and the biases and systematics inherit to the \legacypipe\, pipeline itself. 

Our simulated galaxies must be a representative sample of real ELGs or else we cannot use them as randoms. The next section describes how we generate a representative sample by comparing \tractor\, catalogues from DR5 to  spectroscopically confirmed ELG galaxies from DEEP2.  

\subsection{DEEP2}

In this paper, we only concern ourselves with Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs). These are blue star forming galaxies that are spectroscopically identified by a strong OII emission line. The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey (DEEP2, references) collected one of the largest samples of ELG spectra to date, since the spectral resolution resolves the OII emission line. To model the real population of ELGs, we match our DR3 Tractor catalogues to the DEEP2 catalogues using a 1\arcsec matching radius.

This gives us a sample of ELGs with high confidence redshift (from DEEP2 spectra), brightness (g, r, z flux), and shape (half light radii, ellipticity) information. While the sample is biased by the DEEP2 selection function, the depth of DR5 imaging, and \tractorÕs ability to measure the centroid, brightness, and shape, this is as good as we can do with publicly available data. The best possible sample is probably to use Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Survey (HSC-SS) imaging in the DEEP2 fields (Hayashi et al. 2017, Mehta et al. 2017).

We model the redshift-brightness-shape parameter space with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). DESI and eBOSS have different ELG target selection criteria so we create separate DESI and eBOSS samples. We then divide each of those into a \dev and Exponential galaxy sample, because we find that \dev, in all bands, are larger and one mag brighter than Exponential, on average. 

\section{Simulating eBOSS ELG Galaxies}

\subsection{ELGs Selected By eBOSS}
\label{sec:eboss-targets}

We use the joint tables (provided by Anand) of \tractor \, catalogue measurements for each eBOSS ELG target and the eBOSS spectra obtained for that target,
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss21.v5_10_4.fits|
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss2122.v5_10_7.fits| 
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss22.v5_10_4.fits|
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss23.v5_10_4.fits|
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss23.v5_10_7.fits|
\end{itemize}

\noindent to build a Gaussian Mixture Model for the brightness, shape, and redshift of eBOSS ELG targets. We assume that all galaxies that \tractor \, classifies as type PSF are compact or unresolved. We reclassify them as EXP with $\rhalf = \text{avg}(\text{FWHM}) / 2)$, where the average is over all bands. We also reclassify SIMP sources as EXP. We drop COMP sources because these comprise less than 1\% of the sample. 
%keep galaxies having reasonable \tractor\, measured $\rhalf$.

DEV galaxies are systematically larger and about 1 mag brighter than EXP in all bands (see Fig. \ref{fig:dev-brighter}), so we split the above sample into separate DEV and EXP samples. Fig. \ref{fig:ngc-incomplete} also shows that the NGC region is not complete for the \gb \,mag of the eBOSS ELGs, so we throw out all the NGC galaxies (about 30\% of the sample). This yields 77,525 EXP and 7,439 DEV galaxies. We refer to this as our eBOSS sample. The full list of cuts we apply is:
%9\% of the original sample is DEV, but they fill in parameter space enough for use to model. 
\begin{itemize}
\item !NGC
\item \verb|z_flag == 1| 
\item $0 \le \text{redshift} \le 2$
\item \verb|brick_primary|
\item $\text{type} \neq \text{COMP}$
\item $\rhalf  > 0.131$\arcsec\, (Nyquist limit, one half of the DECam pixel scale)
\item (EXP) $\rhalf  < 2.5$\arcsec
\item (DEV) $\rhalf  < 5.0$\arcsec
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dev_brighter}
 \caption{PDFs of \gb, \rband, \zb mag (top) and redshift and $\rhalf$ (bottom) for eBOSS ELG targets that are spectroscopically confirmed to be galaxies. DEV galaxies (red) are systematically larger and about 1 mag brighter than EXP galaxies, in all bands. We reclassify PSF sources as EXP with $\rhalf = \text{avg}(\text{FWHM}) / 2)$, where the average is over all bands.}
 \label{fig:dev-brighter}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=5 cm]{ngc_incomplete}
 \caption{The eBOSS NGC footprint is not deep enough to detect eBOSS ELGs with $g < 22.825$ mag. We remove galaxies in the NGC region from our sample of representative ELGs.}
 \label{fig:ngc-incomplete}
\end{figure}

Because the SGC \gb \, mag PDF in Fig \ref{fig:ngc-incomplete} is a step function for $g > 22.825$, a Gaussian Mixture model for the brightness, shape, and redshift distribution of eBOSS ELGs will be inaccurate at the faint \gb \, mag, where most of the ELGs reside. To model the full distribution of ELG properties we bootstrap sample from our eBOSS sample.

\subsection{ELGs Almost Selected By eBOSS}
\label{sec:eboss-almost-targets}

In addition to simulating eBOSS ELGs, we want to test contamination by injecting ELGs just outside of the eBOSS selection boundaries; however, the eBOSS sample does not extend beyond the selection boundaries. We create a DR3-DEEP2 matched sample using a 1\arcsec\, matching radius and keeping the nearest match. We reclassify SIMP and PSF sources as EXP the same way we did for the eBOSS sample (see Section \ref{sec:eboss-targets}), and then  apply the following cuts, 
\begin{itemize}
\item !NGC
\item INSERT DEEP2 FLAG THAT SAYS THE OBJECT IS A GALAXY
\item $0 \le \text{redshift} \le 2$
\item \verb|brick_primary|
\item \gb, \rband, \zb $\text{flux} > 0$
\item \gb, \rband, \zb $\text{flux ivar} > 0$
\item $\text{type} \neq \text{COMP}$
\item $\rhalf  > 0.131$\arcsec\, (Nyquist limit, one half of the DECam pixel scale)
\item (EXP) $\rhalf  < 2.5$\arcsec
\item (DEV) $\rhalf  < 5.0$\arcsec
\end{itemize}

We find that the DR3-DEEP2 sample reproduces the brightness, shape, and redshift distributions of the eBOSS sample. Fig. \ref{fig:dr3dp2-reproduces} shows the PDFs of \gb, \rband, \zb, redshift, and $\rhalf$ for EXP galaxies, and that the DR3-DEEP2 galaxies (cut to eBOSS ELG targets) agree very well with the eBOSS sample. Fig. \ref{fig:dr3dp2-redshift} shows that for EXP galaxies, \gb, \rband, \zb, and $\rhalf$ depend on redshift in the same way for the DR3-DEEP2 galaxies (cut to eBOSS ELG targets) and the eBOSS sample. A similar level of agreement occurs for DEV galaxies.

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dr3dp2_reproduces}
 \caption{PDFs of \gb, \rband, \zb, redshift, and $\rhalf$ for EXP galaxies. The DR3-DEEP2 galaxies (blue), cut to type EXP galaxies, the SGC footprint, and eBOSS ELG targets, reproduces the brightness, shape, and redshift distributions of the eBOSS sample (red).}
 \label{fig:dr3dp2-reproduces}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dr3dp2_redshift_trends}
 \caption{For EXP galaxies, \gb, \rband, \zb, and $\rhalf$ depend on redshift in the same way for the DR3-DEEP2 galaxies (red) and the eBOSS sample (blue). SWAP COLORS SO BLUE IS DR3-DP2 LIKE PREV FIG}
 \label{fig:dr3dp2-redshift}
\end{figure}

Because DR3-DEEP2 galaxies are representative of eBOSS ELGs and extend beyond the eBOSS selection boundaries, we can construct a sample of ELG-like galaxies to test contamination into the eBOSS selected sample. We choose to keep DR3-DEEP2 SGC galaxies within a padding of 0.2 mag of the eBOSSS selection boundaries, yielding a sample of 1,064 EXP and 85 DEV galaxies. Burleigh \& Moustakas 2018, in prep show that \tractor\, flux measurements are accurate to 0.1 - 0.2 mag for \gb $\sim 22.9$ galaxies, so a padding of 0.2 mag should capture most contaminants due to \tractor\, measurement errors. 

\subsection{Simulating eBOSS ELGs with the correct n(z)}
\label{sec:final-eboss-sample}

We now describe our algorithm for jointly sampling from the n(z) for eBOSS and from the eBOSS and DR3-DEEP2 samples described in Sections \ref{sec:eboss-targets} and \ref{sec:eboss-almost-targets}. Fig. \ref{fig:dr3dp2-vs-eboss} compares the eBOSS and DR3-DEEP2 samples for EXP and DEV galaxies.

\begin{figure}
     \subfloat[type EXP\label{fig:dr3dp2-vs-eboss-exp}]{%
       \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dr3dp2_vs_eboss_exp}

     \subfloat[type DEV\label{fig:dr3dp2-vs-eboss-dev}]{%
       \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dr3dp2_vs_eboss_dev}
     }
\caption{PDFs of \gb, \rband, \zb mag, $\rhalf$, and redshift for galaxies from the eBOSS (blue) and DR3-DEEP2 (red) samples. (Top) EXP galaxies. (Bottom) DEV galaxies. The DR3-DEEP2 sample includes galaxies within 0.2 mag of the eBOSS ELG target selection boundaries, so it is brighter and fainter than the eBOSS sample. The DR3-DEEP2 DEV are noisy because the sample size is so small (85 galaxies).}
\label{fig:dr3dp2-vs-eboss}
\end{figure}

To build a sample with the correct n(z) we intentionally over-fit a Gaussian Mixture Model to the n(z) from eBOSS spectra. The NGC imaging data are incomplete, so we drop NGC spectra and weight by the spectroscopic completeness (1/TSR in the \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss*.fits| tables). Fig. \ref{fig:nz} shows the resulting n(z) and that a 10 component GMM reproduces it well. 

\begin{figure}
     \subfloat[eBOSS SGC\label{fig:nz-eboss}]{%
       \includegraphics[width=0.49\columnwidth]{nz_eboss}
     }

     }
\caption{(Left) n(z) for eBOSS SGC based on eBOSS 21, 22, and 23 spectra. (Right) Overplotting the PDF from 10,000 draws from our 10 component GMM for n(z), which intentionally over-fits the data.}
\label{fig:nz}
\end{figure}

We now generate a sample of properties for N ELGs that are representative of real ELGs in eBOSS and that \obiwan\, can inject into the DECaLS images. We draw N samples from our n(z) GMM, drop those outside the allowed redshift range [0,2], redraw the number dropped, and repeat until there are N samples. Each sample gets a unique id, which is an integer [1,N] that we call ``id". For each of the N redshifts, we find the nearest redshift in the combined EXP and DEV DR3-DEEP2 sample. This is a n(z)-weighted draw from ELG-like galaxies within 0.2 mag of the eBOSS ELG SGC target selection boundaries. (A) If the DR3-DEEP2 data point is an ELG under the eBOSS ELG SGC target selection, we ignore the DR3-DEEP2 data point and find the nearest redshift in the EXP eBOSS sample (90\% of the time) or the DEV eBOSS sample (10\% of the time). (B) If the DR3-DEEP2 data point is not an eBOSS ELG SGC target, we ignore the DR3-DEEP2 data point and find the nearest redshift in the subset of the EXP DR3-DEEP2 sample that only included non-eBOSS ELG SGC target selected galaxies (90\% of the time) or the same subset of the DEV DR3-DEEP2 sample (10\% of the time). We now have a redshift (drawn from the n(z) GMM) and a \gb, \rband, \zb mag, $\rhalf$, and sersic index (either 1 or 4) for each of the N draws. We add a random RA and Dec coordinate, positions angle, minor to major axis ratio to each of the N draws. We assign an id saying where the brightness and shape information came from, which we call \verb|id_sample|. This is the SDSS-ID (\verb|plate-mjd-fiberid|) if from the EXP or DEV eBOSS samples or the \tractor-ID (\verb|brickid-objid|) if from the  EXP or DEV DR3-DEEP2 samples. Fig. \ref{fig:final-eboss-sample-10k} shows the PDFs of \gb, \rband, \zb, redshift, and $\rhalf$ for 10,000 draws using the above algorithm.

\subsection{Injecting the ELGs with \obiwan}

We inject X simulated galaxies (i.e. randoms), at a density of X / deg$^2$ (X / brick), into the set of DECam CCDs used to produce DR3-era \tractor\, catalogues and the eBOSS ELG target lists \citep{anand17}. Fig. \ref{fig:ccds-eboss} shows these CCDs and the eBOSS NGC and SGC regions that we consider. Heatmaps of the number density of simulated galaxies added to each brick are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:number-density-eboss}. X\% of the injected galaxies are ELGs under the eBOSS ELG target selections, so we are injecting, on average, X ELGs / deg$^2$ which will be reduced further by whichever \legacypipe detects and models.

Figs. \ref{fig:rec-lost-contam-color} shows how the distribution of ELGs in the eBOSS color box depends on sources that \tractor \, correctly measures as ELGs, contamination (are not ELGs but pass the target selection cuts for \tractor\, measurements), and lost sources (either to the source being an ELG but \tractor \, measurement failing target selection, \legacypipe\, source detection not finding the source, or the source is removed by the {\tt{fracin}} cut (see Fig. \ref{fig:dflux-systematic}).

Although source detection is independent of source type, \tractor model selection is biased against \dev\, galaxies (see Fig. \ref{fig:hbar}). An equal fraction of exponential and \dev\, galaxies are detected by \legacypipe (recovered), but the majority of \dev\, galaxies are misclassified as exponential. Fig. \ref{fig:confusion-matrix-eboss-ngc} quantifies the model selection bias. About 70\% of \dev\, galaxies are misclassified by \tractor\, compared to only 5\% for exponential galaxies. Fig. \ref{fig:grz-hist-type} shows that this bias towards EXP sources may not bias \tractor's flux measurements because EXP and DEV sources have nearly identical \gb, \rband, \zb distributions. SIMP and PSF sources are generally fainter sources near the detection limit, with PSF sources being about 0.1 - 0.2 mag fainter, so a bias towards SIMP galaxies would bias \tractor's flux measurements.

\obiwan\, injects sources at the nearest pixel center, so there is a systematic offset of 0.4\arcsec in the RA and Dec residuals between the true source centroid and \tractor's measurement of it (see Fig. \ref{fig:delta-radec}). The offset would be equal to the DECaLS pixel scale, 0.262\arcsec / pixel, but co-registry and simultaneous fitting of multiple images makes it larger.

\obiwan\, provides a \tractor-independent measurement for depth. It is the magnitude of the source for which the chance of recovery (i.e. detecting it then deciding that it is a bonafide astrophysical source) is 50\% . Fig. \ref{fig:fraction-recovered} shows the fraction of exponential $\rhalf=0.5$\arcsec galaxies that are recovered by \legacypipe\, versus source magnitude for subset 60. The fraction is never less than 0.5 so subset 60 is more than 0.5 mag deeper than full-depth in all bands. This is good for our images of the COSMOS region, but bad for DECaLS because any conclusions that the DECaLS Team has derived from subset 60 will be too optimistic. 
% We can also ask, what magnitude source in these images becomes a 5\sigma detection with \tractor? (this depends on tractor flux ivar so is not independent of tractor)

\section{Two Point Correlation Function}
The two point correlation function, applied to galaxy survey data, says whether the galaxies are clustered or under-dense, relative to a random distribution, at different length scales (i.e. separations between pairs of galaxies). The 2D (angular) correlation function is computed by measuring the positions of galaxies in images of the night sky. The 3D correction function combines the 2D information with the distance to each galaxy from Earth (e.g. measured from a spectrum).

Computing the correlation function reduces to counting all pairs of galaxies with separation falling within a given bin. \cite{landy93} showed that 

\begin{align}
\xi(\Delta s) = \frac{GG(\Delta s) - 2 GR (\Delta s) + RR (\Delta s)}{RR (\Delta s)} \label{eqn:lz93}
\end{align}

\noindent is an unbiased estimator for the correlation function, where galaxy-galaxy (GG), galaxy-random (GR), and random-random (RR) are the pair counts in separation ($\Delta s$) bins. We use a different notation than the literature, GG instead of DD (data-data) and GR instead of DR (data-random), because we want to emphasize that the data are images and we are performing all kinds of analyses to select a potentially biased sample of galaxies. The randoms are a sample of random locations on a unit sphere that are then modified by the same procedure used to select the galaxy sample.   

The resulting correlation function is systematically over- and under-dense at different scales due to correlations between galaxy counts and imaging systematics, such as stellar density, seeing, galactic extinction, etc. (Ross et al papers). The correlation function is the expectation value of the number of galaxy pairs, so it is intuitive to write it as a weighted sum, where each weight represents the fraction of those pairs that are over- or under-represented in the sample. In SDSS, a linear model was fit to each imaging systematic correlation and then used to up- or down-sample the number of galaxies depending on the value of the systematic(s) in the region of the image where the galaxies came from. We refer to this post-processing weighting procedure as the {\it{old method}}. We now describe our {\it{new method}} Monte Carlo simulation method, which does not require this weighting procedure. 

We add fake galaxies to the images at random locations, run {\tt{Tractor}}, and the fake galaxies recovered by the Tractor become the randoms. This is true if and only if the fake galaxies we inject are representative of the real ELG galaxies we are interested in for DESI science. These randoms have been modified by the full covariance between all imaging systematics. In principle, this includes systematics we didn't expect, not just stellar density, seeing, extinction, etc. as identified in previous studies.

To simplify terminology, we use {\it{uniform randoms}} to refer to random positions in the footprint, and {\it{obiwan randoms}} to refer to the subset of uniform randoms that are recovered by {\tt{Tractor}}. We wish to test our method over a large footprint, so we ran \obiwan\, on about 500 deg$^2$ of the DR5\footnote{\url{http://legacysurvey.org/status/}} footprint, and present the resulting angular correlation functions in Section \ref{sec:dr5}. We build on these results in Section \ref{sec:eboss}, presenting correlation functions from running \obiwan on the eBOSS NGC and SGC footprints, excluding eboss25.

\section{Simulating DESI ELG Galaxies}

We inject simulated galaxies into X deg$^2$ of DR5 imaging at density of X galaxies / deg$^2$. About X\% of the simulated galaxies are DESI ELGs, so this is X times larger than DESI target density. 

\subsection{Simulated Galaxy Sample}

We match DR3 to DEEP2 cutting to only spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. 

\dev comprise less than 3\% of the DESI sample, and do not model them because the sample size is too small to capture the underlying distributions in redshift and brightness. For DESI, we apply the following cuts,

{\it{ALL}}
\begin{itemize}
\item flux $>$ 0, ivar $>$ 0
\item rename ``EXP, REX, and SIMP'' as EXP
\item rename ``PSF" as EXP but with rhalf= avg(psfsize g,r,z) / 2
\item rhalf $<$ 5
\end{itemize}

{\it{DESI + EXP (DEV, COMP dropped)}}
\begin{itemize}
\item redshift >= 0.8-0.2 and redshift <= 1.4 + 0.2, so we donÕt fit a gaussian to a step function
\item 0.5 mag padding perpendicular to the TS box
\item 0.5 mag deeper than than g,r,z depth limits
\item fit GMM to [fwhm-OR-rhalf, g-r, r-z,z,redshift], 8 components doesn't overfit but captures correlations between variables
\item draw N points, drop points with LogicalOr (0.8 < redshift > 1.4, more than 0.5 deeper than g, r, z limits, and rhalf > pixscale/2), redraw as many points as dropped, repeat until have N points
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Brightness and shape with the appropriate n(z)}

We model the DESI n(z) for ELGs by over-fitting a GMM model to the desired n(z) for DESI. We randomly sampled 100,000 points from the Sanchez \& Kirkby ELG mocks, then fit a 12 component GMM to the resulting n(z) since this reproduced the n(z) very well.

The procedure for generating the sample of ELGs with representative properties for DESI is as follows. We have GMM models for n(z) and the joint distribution of redshift, brightness, and shape. Draw N samples from the n(z) model. Draw 10k samples from the redshift, brigthness, shape model, filtering out points outside the redshift or detection limits. Organize the 10k samples in a KD Tree. For each of the N samples, find the nearest redshift in the 10k sample, and assign the corresponding brightness and shape. This becomes the sample we inject into the imaging data. It has the exact n(z) for DESI or eBOSS and reasonable brightnesses and shapes for each redshift. 42\% of the DESI sample is in the DESI TS box. Note, we repeated the above procedure using DR2 and DR3, respectively, instead of DR5 and ended up with similar Gaussian Mixture Models.
