\section{Introduction}

\cite{anand17}
The imaging imaging systematics in SDSS turned out to be fairly independent of one another, so they could be removed with linear models for them (ashley's papers). However, the imaging systematics in the next generation of galaxy surveys (astronomy data sets) will be highly correlated. The data will come from a joint analysis of multiple telescopes' data and/or will have data of the same part of the sky collected over long timelines (months or years).

We want the measure the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal, but there are shortcomings in the current methods, such as having apriori knowledge of all the possible imaging systematics in the galaxy survey dataset. DESI will obtain spectra of about 30M galaxies that will be targeted based on multi-band imaging from three telescopes. eBOSS has already targeted and obtained spectra for about \# ELG galaxies, based on DECam data. People have already started confronting this issue, and the previous weight fitting was extended to multiple dimensions (features). Poole et al fit to 25 maps simultaneously.

This paper is the first analysis of large scale data, in this case for eBOSS and DESI, that uses \obiwan\, (Burleigh \& Moustakas 2018, in prep), which is a non-parametric method that corrects for the full covariance of imaging systematics. We perform a trial run on X deg$^2$ of the DR5 footprint, and then run \obiwan\, on the actual eBOSS footprint, restricting to the footprint described in CITE ANANDS PAPER. From these runs, we measure the impact of \obiwan\, on the primary science objectives of eBOSS and extrapolate to DESI. All data products are available at NERSC (see Section \ref{sec:data-products}).

\section{Methods}

\subsection{\obiwan}

The five images in Fig. \ref{fig:1000-words} show how Obiwan works. The process is identical to how the Legacy Survey Team produces their Public Data Releases, with one exception. Every time Legacypipe reads an image, we add sim- ulated sources to it. The pipeline doesn't know about the simulated sources so the source detection and model fitting procedure is unaltered. For more details see Burleigh \& Moustakas 2018, in prep. Fig. \ref{fig:examples-faint} show examples of real and simulated ELG-like galaxies with similar \gb \, magnitude that are near the DECaLS detection limit. 
%The ELGs are at our detection limits so visual inspection of single exposure images containing ELGs is challenging.

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{obiwan_1000_words}
 \caption{Example of \obiwan\, adding 4 simulated galaxies to a \gb, \rband, and \zb\, DECam image (200x200 pixels). The original image (top left) is modified by adding 4 simulated galaxies (top middle) to create the new image (top right), which {\tt{Tractor}} operates on. The model and residual images are the bottom panels. Two of the simulated galaxies (the more compact ones) have \dev profiles, while the other two have exponential profiles.}
 \label{fig:1000-words}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

 \caption{Real and simulated ELG-like galaxies near the DECaLS \gb \, detection limit, with similar \gb\, magnitude. The label for each image is on the left (R for real and F for fake or simulated) and its corresponding g-band magnitude is the number on the right. Each row is a single galaxy. The first column is a three color jpeg for easy visualization. The remaining columns are the per-band full resolution coadds for the \gb, \rband, \zb\, images and associated inverse variance maps. Consecutive rows of R and F (rows 1 and 2, 3 and 4, etc.) have similar g-band magnitude for a fair comparison.}
 \label{fig:examples-faint}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Randoms}

We add fake galaxies to the images at random locations, run \legacypipe, and repeat until there are many more simulated galaxies than real ones. The simulated galaxies that \legacypipe\, detects and models are the ``randoms" that a correlation function estimator would use. These randoms have been modified by the full covariance between all imaging systematics, those we expect such as stellar density and seeing, those previously unknown, and the biases and systematics inherit to the \legacypipe\, pipeline itself. 

Our simulated galaxies must be a representative sample of real ELGs or else we cannot use them as randoms. The next section describes how we generate a representative sample by comparing \tractor\, catalogues from DR5 to  spectroscopically confirmed ELG galaxies from DEEP2.  

\subsection{DEEP2}

In this paper, we only concern ourselves with Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs). These are blue star forming galaxies that are spectroscopically identified by a strong OII emission line. The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey (DEEP2, references) collected one of the largest samples of ELG spectra to date, since the spectral resolution resolves the OII emission line. To model the real population of ELGs, we match our DR3 Tractor catalogues to the DEEP2 catalogues using a 1\arcsec matching radius.

This gives us a sample of ELGs with high confidence redshift (from DEEP2 spectra), brightness (g, r, z flux), and shape (half light radii, ellipticity) information. While the sample is biased by the DEEP2 selection function, the depth of DR5 imaging, and \tractorÕs ability to measure the centroid, brightness, and shape, this is as good as we can do with publicly available data. The best possible sample is probably to use Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Survey (HSC-SS) imaging in the DEEP2 fields (Hayashi et al. 2017, Mehta et al. 2017).

We model the redshift-brightness-shape parameter space with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). DESI and eBOSS have different ELG target selection criteria so we create separate DESI and eBOSS samples. We then divide each of those into a \dev and Exponential galaxy sample, because we find that \dev, in all bands, are larger and one mag brighter than Exponential, on average. 

\section{X deg$^2$ of DR5}

We inject simulated galaxies into X deg$^2$ of DR5 imaging at density of X galaxies / deg$^2$. About X\% of the simulated galaxies are DESI ELGs, so this is X times larger than DESI target density. 

\subsection{Simulated Galaxy Sample}

We match DR3 to DEEP2 cutting to only spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. 

\dev comprise less than 3\% of the DESI sample, and do not model them because the sample size is too small to capture the underlying distributions in redshift and brightness. For DESI, we apply the following cuts,

{\it{ALL}}
\begin{itemize}
\item flux $>$ 0, ivar $>$ 0
\item rename ``EXP, REX, and SIMP'' as EXP
\item rename ``PSF" as EXP but with rhalf= avg(psfsize g,r,z) / 2
\item rhalf $<$ 5
\end{itemize}

{\it{DESI + EXP (DEV, COMP dropped)}}
\begin{itemize}
\item redshift >= 0.8-0.2 and redshift <= 1.4 + 0.2, so we donÕt fit a gaussian to a step function
\item 0.5 mag padding perpendicular to the TS box
\item 0.5 mag deeper than than g,r,z depth limits
\item fit GMM to [fwhm-OR-rhalf, g-r, r-z,z,redshift], 8 components doesn't overfit but captures correlations between variables
\item draw N points, drop points with LogicalOr (0.8 < redshift > 1.4, more than 0.5 deeper than g, r, z limits, and rhalf > pixscale/2), redraw as many points as dropped, repeat until have N points
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Brightness and shape with the appropriate n(z)}

We model the DESI n(z) for ELGs by over-fitting a GMM model to the desired n(z) for DESI. We randomly sampled 100,000 points from the Sanchez \& Kirkby ELG mocks, then fit a 12 component GMM to the resulting n(z) since this reproduced the n(z) very well.

The procedure for generating the sample of ELGs with representative properties for DESI is as follows. We have GMM models for n(z) and the joint distribution of redshift, brightness, and shape. Draw N samples from the n(z) model. Draw 10k samples from the redshift, brigthness, shape model, filtering out points outside the redshift or detection limits. Organize the 10k samples in a KD Tree. For each of the N samples, find the nearest redshift in the 10k sample, and assign the corresponding brightness and shape. This becomes the sample we inject into the imaging data. It has the exact n(z) for DESI or eBOSS and reasonable brightnesses and shapes for each redshift. 42\% of the DESI sample is in the DESI TS box. Note, we repeated the above procedure using DR2 and DR3, respectively, instead of DR5 and ended up with similar Gaussian Mixture Models.

\section{eBOSS NGC and SGC}

We inject simulated galaxies into all DECaLS imaging (DR3 and ``DR3-plus") used to select ELG targets by CITE ANAND PAPER. We inject the galaxies at a density of X galaxies / deg$^2$. About X\% of the simulated galaxies are eBOSS ELGs, so this is X times larger than eBOSS target density.

     }
\caption{The eBOSS NGC and SGC footprints (blue boxes) and the DECaLS CCDs from the \tractor\, catalogues that used to select ELG targets.}
\label{fig:ccds-eboss}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Brightness, shape, and redshift for eBOSS ELGs}
\label{sec:eboss-targets}

We use the joint tables (provided by Anand) of \tractor \, catalogue measurements for each eBOSS ELG target and the eBOSS spectra obtained for that target,
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss21.v5_10_4.fits|
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss2122.v5_10_7.fits| 
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss22.v5_10_4.fits|
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss23.v5_10_4.fits|
\item \verb|eBOSS.ELG.obiwan.eboss23.v5_10_7.fits|
\end{itemize}

\noindent to build a Gaussian Mixture Model for the brightness, shape, and redshift of eBOSS ELG targets. We assume that all galaxies that \tractor \, classifies as type PSF are compact or unresolved. We reclassify them as EXP with $\rhalf = \text{avg}(\text{FWHM}) / 2)$, where the average is over all bands. We also reclassify SIMP sources as EXP. We drop COMP sources because these comprise less than 1\% of the sample. We only keep galaxies having reasonable \tractor\, measured $\rhalf$,
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|z_flag == 1 & brick_primary & |$\rhalf < 10$\arcsec.
\end{itemize}
DEV galaxies are systematically larger and about 1 mag brighter than EXP in all bands (see Fig. \ref{fig:dev-brighter}), so we split the above sample into separate DEV and EXP samples. Fig. \ref{fig:ngc-incomplete} also shows that the NGC region is not complete for the \gb \,mag of the eBOSS ELGs, so we throw out all the NGC galaxies (about 30\% of the sample). This yields 7,500 DEV and 78,000 EXP galaxies.  
%9\% of the original sample is DEV, but they fill in parameter space enough for use to model. 

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dev_brighter}
 \caption{PDFs of \gb, \rband, \zb mag (top) and redshift and $\rhalf$ (bottom) for eBOSS ELG targets that are spectroscopically confirmed to be galaxies. DEV galaxies (red) are systematically larger and about 1 mag brighter than EXP galaxies, in all bands. We reclassify PSF sources as EXP with $\rhalf = \text{avg}(\text{FWHM}) / 2)$, where the average is over all bands.}
 \label{fig:dev-brighter}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=5 cm]{ngc_incomplete}
 \caption{The eBOSS NGC footprint is not deep enough to detect eBOSS ELGs with $g < 22.825$ mag. We remove galaxies in the NGC region from our sample of representative ELGs.}
 \label{fig:ngc-incomplete}
\end{figure}

Because the SGC \gb \, mag PDF in Fig \ref{fig:ngc-incomplete} is a step function for $g > 22.825$, a Gaussian Mixture model for the brightness, shape, and redshift distribution of eBOSS ELGs will be inaccurate at the faint \gb \, mag, where most of the ELGs reside. We bootstrap sample from our 78,000 EXP and 7,500 DEV samples instead.

\subsection{Brightness, shape, and redshift for ELGs outside the eBOSS Target Selection Box}
\label{sec:eboss-almost-targets}

We want to inject ELGs with \obiwan\, that are inside and outside of the eBOSS ELG target selection box; however, the EXP and DEV samples from Section \ref{sec:eboss-targets} do not go outside the target selection box. We find that the a DR3-DEEP2 catalogue, using 1\arcsec matching, reproduces the brightness, shape, and redshift distribution of the EXP and DEV samples from Section \ref{sec:eboss-targets}, when the eBOSS target selection is applied. Fig. \ref{fig:dr3dp2-reproduces} shows that the \gb, \rband, \zb, redshift, and $\rhalf$ histograms, for the DR3-DEEP2 catalogue and the EXP sample from Section \ref{sec:eboss-targets}, agree very well for EXP galaxies in the SGC. Fig. \ref{fig:dr3dp2-redshift} shows that the \gb, \rband, \zb, and $\rhalf$ dependence on redshift is also very similar for the EXP galaxies in the SGC. DEV galaxies in the SGC show similar agreement.

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dr3dp2_reproduces}
 \caption{}
 \label{fig:dr3dp2-reproduces}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dr3dp2_redshift_trends}
 \caption{}
 \label{fig:dr3dp2-redshift}
\end{figure}

The DR3-DEEP2 catalogue contains galaxies outside the eBOSS target selection box. Figs. \ref{fig:dr3dp2-reproduces} and \ref{fig:dr3dp2-redshift} show that these galaxies are representative of eBOSS ELGs, so this gives us a sample of ELG-like galaxies outside of the eBOSS target selection box. We keep DR3-DEEP2 catalogue SGC galaxies within 0.2 mag of the eBOSSS target selection, and end up with 1,000 EXP and 100 DEV galaxies. This is a small sample, but better than nothing.  

We apply the following cuts to the eBOSS SGC and DR3-DEEP2 samples,
\begin{itemize}
\item 0 <= redshift <= 2 and rhalf > pixscale/2
\item EXP: cut to rhalf < 2.5
\item DEV: cut to rhalf < 5.0
\item DR3-DEEP2 points: also cut to min(gmag in SGC sample) - 0.2 <= gmag in DR3Dp2 sample <= max(gmag in SGC sample) + 0.2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Brightness and shape with the appropriate n(z)}

Sections \ref{sec:eboss-targets} and \ref{sec:eboss-almost-targets} collected four eBOSS ELG-like samples: DR3DP2 EXP (1064 poitns), DR3DP2 DEV (85 points), SGC EXP (77k points), and SGC DEV (7k points). Fig. \ref{fig:dr3dp2-vs-eboss} shows how the EXP samples compare. There are many more data points in the SGC EXP sample, but the DR3DP2 EXP sample extends to fainter and brighter \gb, \rband, and \zb \, mag ELG-like galaxies.


\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dr3dp2_vs_eboss_sample}
 \caption{}
 \label{fig:dr3dp2-vs-eboss}
\end{figure}


We model the eBOSS n(z) for ELGs by over-fitting a GMM model to the actual n(z) measured from eBOSS spectra. We compute the actual n(z) by dropping NGC data (its incomplete) and weighting by spectroscopic completeness (e.g. 1/TSR in the eBOSS catalogues). A 10 component GMM reproduces the n(z) well. 

The procedure for generating the sample of ELGs with representative properties for eBOSS is as follows. We draw N samples from the n(z) model, drop those outside the 0 <= redshift <= 2 limits, redraw the number dropped, and repeat until there are N samples. Next, combine the DR3DP2 ELG and DR3DP2 DEV samples and organize in a KD Tree. For each of the N points, find the nearest redshift in the KD Tree, and ask whether the corresponding brightness in in the TS box or not (this is equivalent to a coin flip with p = fraction of the DR3DP2 ELG and DR3DP2 DEV sample that is the in the TS box). If in the box, find the nearest redshift in the SGC/eBOSS sample and assign the associated brightness and shape. 90\% of the time use the EXP SGC/eBOSS sample and 10\% the DEV SGC/eBOSS sample. If not in the box, find the nearest redshift in the DR3-DEEP2 sample (90\% of the time the EXP one, 10\% the DEV one). Note, the eBOSS sample that comes from inside the TS box has the SDSS-ID of the spectrum that itÕs redshift came from.

There is a 0.4\arcsec offset in both RA and Dec because \obiwan injects sources at the nearest pixel center. We expected this offset to be no larger than the DECaLS pixel scale, 0.262\arcsec / pixel, but (possibly due to co-registry or simultaneous fitting of multiple images) is it apparently 0.4\arcsec\, instead.}

\section{Two Point Correlation Function}
The two point correlation function, applied to galaxy survey data, says whether the galaxies are clustered or under-dense, relative to a random distribution, at different length scales (i.e. separations between pairs of galaxies). The 2D (angular) correlation function is computed by measuring the positions of galaxies in images of the night sky. The 3D correction function combines the 2D information with the distance to each galaxy from Earth (e.g. measured from a spectrum).

Computing the correlation function reduces to counting all pairs of galaxies with separation falling within a given bin. \cite{landy93} showed that 

\begin{align}
\xi(\Delta s) = \frac{GG(\Delta s) - 2 GR (\Delta s) + RR (\Delta s)}{RR (\Delta s)} \label{eqn:lz93}
\end{align}

\noindent is an unbiased estimator for the correlation function, where galaxy-galaxy (GG), galaxy-random (GR), and random-random (RR) are the pair counts in separation ($\Delta s$) bins. We use a different notation than the literature, GG instead of DD (data-data) and GR instead of DR (data-random), because we want to emphasize that the data are images and we are performing all kinds of analyses to select a potentially biased sample of galaxies. The randoms are a sample of random locations on a unit sphere that are then modified by the same procedure used to select the galaxy sample.   

The resulting correlation function is systematically over- and under-dense at different scales due to correlations between galaxy counts and imaging systematics, such as stellar density, seeing, galactic extinction, etc. (Ross et al papers). The correlation function is the expectation value of the number of galaxy pairs, so it is intuitive to write it as a weighted sum, where each weight represents the fraction of those pairs that are over- or under-represented in the sample. In SDSS, a linear model was fit to each imaging systematic correlation and then used to up- or down-sample the number of galaxies depending on the value of the systematic(s) in the region of the image where the galaxies came from. We refer to this post-processing weighting procedure as the {\it{old method}}. We now describe our {\it{new method}} Monte Carlo simulation method, which does not require this weighting procedure. 

We add fake galaxies to the images at random locations, run {\tt{Tractor}}, and the fake galaxies recovered by the Tractor become the randoms. This is true if and only if the fake galaxies we inject are representative of the real ELG galaxies we are interested in for DESI science. These randoms have been modified by the full covariance between all imaging systematics. In principle, this includes systematics we didn't expect, not just stellar density, seeing, extinction, etc. as identified in previous studies.

To simplify terminology, we use {\it{uniform randoms}} to refer to random positions in the footprint, and {\it{obiwan randoms}} to refer to the subset of uniform randoms that are recovered by {\tt{Tractor}}. We wish to test our method over a large footprint, so we ran \obiwan\, on about 500 deg$^2$ of the DR5\footnote{\url{http://legacysurvey.org/status/}} footprint, and present the resulting angular correlation functions in Section \ref{sec:dr5}. We build on these results in Section \ref{sec:eboss}, presenting correlation functions from running \obiwan on the eBOSS NGC and SGC footprints, excluding eboss25.

\section{Plots to Make}
\begin{itemize}
\item galdepth vs. obi wan measured depth, where does the 20\% from validation fall?
\item n(z) resulting from different depths
\item autocorrelation functions for uniform-uniform rand, obiwan-obiwan rand
\item cross correlate everything: (DD=obiwan-rand, RR=uniform-rand), (DD=DR5, RR=uniform-rand), (DD=DR5, RR=obiwan-rand), compare DR5 correlation with known systematics to obiwan-rand with know systematics 
\item plots: BAO fit to angular CF 
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

\section{Target Selection and Tractor Catalogue Cuts for ELGs}

We use the following target selection and Tractor catalogue cuts to construct our ELG samples for DESI and eBOSS. The ``baseline'' ELG target selection for DESI is  

For eBOSS SGC it is

The color-color box for NGC target selection is a subset of the above, so we simply use the SGC selection in this paper. For both the DESI and eBOSS sample, we apply the following ``quality assurance'' cuts:
